# Laratype Framework

Laratype is a TypeSafe RestAPI Framework built on top of [HonoJS](https://github.com/honojs/hono). The roadmap for Laratype is as follows:

1. Implement all APIs from Laravel.
2. Address the shortcomings of the Laravel framework (written in PHP), such as providing TypeSafety with frontend frameworks (Vue.js, React.js, Svelte).
